      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <p>FinalSay was inspired by a frustrating experience at DECA, a competitive business and debate competition where participants argue their case in front of judges. One of the debates ended in a loss with no reasoning from the judge, causing the perception of an unfair decision. This experience sparked the idea; what if there was a way to get truly objective, constructive feedback that could help debaters improve rather than just telling them they won or lost?</p>
      <p>That's where the idea for FinalSay was born. We wanted to create an AI-powered debate coach that provides constant feedback, helping debaters refine their arguments in real time and strengthen their reasoning.</p>

      <h3>What It Does</h3>
      <p>FinalSay is more than just an AI judge. It acts as a real-time debate coach, giving you continuous feedback to challenge your thinking and improve your argument. Instead of just scoring a debate, our web app provides personalized feedback by asking thought-provoking questions that challenge your argument, expose biases, and highlight improvement.</p>
      <p>Our AI algorithm assesses arguments on both logical and emotional levels centered around the "Triple Bottom Line". Which is a success metric that analyzes arguments on social, economical and environmental feasibility; allowing us to identify strengths, weaknesses, and biases while providing constructive feedback to debaters.</p>
